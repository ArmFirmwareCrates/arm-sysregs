      "message": "I\u0027m somewhat ambivalent about including GIC register definitions in this crate. Although these are Arm v8-A system registers, they\u0027re owned by the GIC and defined in the GIC specification.\nI would strongly discourage accessing these registers directly through these functions, we should steer the users to the arm-gic crate instead.\nMatthew had a patch for redefining the sysreg types: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/RF-A/rusted-firmware-a/+/44725\nThe arm-sysreg crate should expose these accessors using opaque u32/u64 types, so the values can be saved and restored like any other register. The arm-gic crate could then define meaningful, strongly-typed wrappers for those values.",

      "message": "My plan is to have the `arm-gic` crate depend on this one for the system register accessors, though before I can do that I first need to add AArch32 support here.\n\nThe wrapper types for the registers are generated automatically based on the `Registers.json` file for the architecture, so I think they belong in this crate like all the other register types we generate from that same file.",

      "message": "I also meant that `arm-gic` should depend on `arm-sysregs` but the register type definitions should be in `arm-gic`.\n* I think it belongs there.\n* There are several registers that have the same layout, for example `ICC_ASGI1R_EL1`, `ICC_SGI0R_EL1` and `ICC_SGI1R_EL1`. In `arm-gic` we use the same type for all of them.
