      "message": "I noticed that this register has different fields, based on the `ELIsInHost(EL2)` condition. When it\u0027s true, these field names are correct. When it\u0027s false, these low bits have a different name and also bits[11:8] a reserved. I\u0027m not sure what to do about it, since it\u0027s a runtime condition",

      "message": "Right, there are a number of other registers like this. There\u0027s no great solution, but I think the approach I\u0027ve taken here is a reasonable compromise between correctness and usefulness. For cases where the same name refers to multiple different bits depending on some condition I still omit them all, but for cases like this where several different names refer to the same bit I include them. There\u0027s no ambiguity here for the user of the library constructing a value, they can just use the appropriate name when constructing a register value, as they presumably know the context of which runtime conditions apply, and there\u0027s no ambiguity.",

They will need to instead use the appropriate raw value, or we can add some manual constants for this later if we want.",
